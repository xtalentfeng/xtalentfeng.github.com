My research brings a data-driven approach to the study of computer and network security, my work focus on defending the Internet’s physical core infrastructure, and guide the design and deployment of widely-used physical systems. In future work, I plan to focus on IoT security, such as finding some compromised device such as botnets and malware server. As a visiting research student, I plan to publish a few high-quality papers on the research area and develop a good collaboration with the foreign advisor for future joint work.
