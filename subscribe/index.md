## Social Media

If keeping up to date via Atom/RSS feeds is too nerdy for you, I can be found on various social networks. I try to keep myself in check and limit my posts to once or twice a day. I'm not one to barf up a stream of rants or retweets and instead stick with what I know best: Paper by FiftyThree, sarcasm, design, and web development.
