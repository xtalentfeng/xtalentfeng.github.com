[Eko Wave LLC](http://ekowave.com) is a company started by [two](http://twitter.com/endonend) [pals](http://twitter.com/bjpmba) and myself to provide value to niche consumers through well-thought-out applications.

When designing the logo I wanted something that played off of the word *wave* found in our name, while keeping with a color palette we established in Eko's previous life.

Taking things a step further I created a basic style tile[^style-tile] document that helped me brainstorm how color, typography, and imagery fit and sell the concept to my partners. It would also serve as blueprint for me to design the site in browser --- making for a more enjoyable and loose experience instead of being tied to a .PSD mockup I needed to CSSify[^cssify] exactly.

[^style-tile]: Style Tiles are a design deliverable consisting of fonts, colors and interface elements that communicate the essence of a visual brand for the web. ([Learn more](http://styletil.es/))

[^cssify]: Is CSSify even a word?

The end result was a simple one page site that will ultimately grow as we build out our application and service portfolio.
