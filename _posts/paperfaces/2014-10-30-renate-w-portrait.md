PaperFaces portrait of Renate W. inspired by a [photograph on Sktchy](http://sktchy.com/4ml2W).

Played with Surface Pressure and the recently updated Sketch tool in Paper tonight to create this Halloween inspired portrait. By working in reverse and applying white on black (instead of the other around) I was able to achieve a macabre feel to the piece.

The original drawing is [available on Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com/11098-Michael-Rose/659426/remixes) if you want a closer look or to riff off of.
