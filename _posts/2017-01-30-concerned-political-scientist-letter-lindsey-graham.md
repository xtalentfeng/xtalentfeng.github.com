excerpt: "I am a concerned political scientist and used some of that insight to write a letter to Lindsey Graham today. I asked more about his strategy than anything else."

*I did something I never thought I would do. I wrote a letter to a U.S. Senator (Lindsey Graham) to express my misgivings about the current direction of U.S. policy and delivered it to his field office. More than that, I borrowed from some insight in the field to ask him about what exactly his strategy is. I reproduce that letter here, adding links to various sources. This version is slightly edited.*

290 Russell Senate Office Building  
Washington, DC 20510  

Senator Graham,

Greetings from Central, South Carolina. I am well aware that the town I now call home is where you were born and raised. I gleefully mention it to friends when I can since this town is great. I have even frequented the bar that used to be your childhood home. The owners there showed me an old sign that apparently your father had carved to advertise the storefront. My understanding is they bequeathed that to you in the summer of 2015 on the occasion when you announced your presidential run in downtown Central. I hope so. That would be a cool artifact of your childhood to have.

I use that greeting as the proverbial foot in the door to raise concerns I have about the direction of policy more than a week into the Trump administration and to raise additional curiosities about your behavior as a means to deter Trump's worst excesses and pursue your overall goal of re-election. I will start with the policy misgivings first.

Your offices in South Carolina and Washington are likely receiving multiple complaints about the Trump administration, the policies he is proposing, and those same policies you seem to endorse. I will add to those concerns here. Trump's proposed border tax is a regressive consumption tax that falls entirely on consumers. It taxes the wrong people. [Rising protectionism would harm South Carolina](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/23/these-states-would-get-hurt-most-in-a-trump-trade-war.html) the extent to which [the state relies on both foreign direct investment (e.g. BMW)](http://sccommerce.com/news/press-releases/south-carolina-recognized-achievement-foreign-direct-investment) and [exports abroad (e.g. Continental Tire, Michelin)](http://www.goupstate.com/news/20120228/bmw-michelin-drive-increase-in-sc-exports). Rising production costs would lead to [mass layoffs](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/jun/21/donald-trump-has-floated-big-tariffs-what-could-im/). There would be no mistaking where that fault would fall in an era of one-party government in both South Carolina and Washington. It would be a public bad that result in electoral consequences for your party.

I am also concerned about the nature of the personnel Trump has selected for his administration. Michael Flynn is a disgraced former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He turned into a pro-Kremlin conspiracy theorist who now occupies arguably the most important foreign policy adviser position in Washington. Trump's chief strategist, Steve Bannon, talks a lot like a white supremacist and peddles in white supremacist hysteria. I understand both operate in the Executive Office of the Presidency and are thus not subject to Senate advice and consent, but your silence on these two deafens me here. 

His Cabinet picks are no better. Ben Carson [confessed his own incompetence](http://theweek.com/speedreads/662108/ben-carson-reportedly-wont-accept-position-trumps-cabinet-cites-no-government-experience) before Donald Trump appointed him as head of Housing and Urban Development. Betsy Devos made a career of [privatizing the public good of education](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/will-betsy-devos-focus-school-choice-mean-public-education/). She now awaits confirmation as Secretary of Education. Rick Perry named [(or forgot to name, in his infamous gaffe)](http://time.com/4598910/rick-perry-department-energy-oops-gaffe/) the Department of Energy as a department he wants to eliminate. He is now Trump's appointment to manage our nuclear arsenal despite not knowing that was in the job description. Scott Pruitt will head an Environmental Protection Agency, one of Nixon's great advancements for his problematic six years in office, [he wants to obliterate](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/us/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-trump.html). Jeff Sessions, a colleague of yours [too racist in 1986 for a judge spot](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/18/that-time-the-senate-denied-jeff-sessions-a-federal-judgeship-over-accusations-of-racism/?utm_term=.e848bd2592a1), will head the Department of Justice. He will be responsible for civil rights protections he spent a career fighting. That you [so glibly dismissed](https://twitter.com/davidmackau/status/818857615820279808) the concerns of legal experts and law professors in a letter you mentioned during the committee hearings on Sessions does not paint a flattering portrait of you.

Still, the crux of my letter concerns your behavior beyond the policy concerns. I do not know why you have been so uneven in warning that Trump is a public bad *(ed. he is)* while simultaneously trying to curry favors from him and hope for the best.

I should note I have a Ph.D. in political science and am not your typical letter writer. I am a political scientist at Clemson University, which I mention first to qualify that this letter in no way reflects my professional activities or the sentiments of the university. I also mention it because it leads to a unique insight about the logic that underpins your behavior. I am not too naive to know there is no such thing as "putting country over party." Politicians care first about re-election, an argument that has aged well since David Mayhew (1974) gave its first full-throated argument in [*The Electoral Connection*](https://www.amazon.com/Congress-Electoral-Connection-David-Mayhew/dp/0300105878). Lawmakers advance the national interest only the extent to which it maps well with the individual electoral interest. This sounds like an indictment of your character, but it is not. It is just a fact of life about the field I have dedicated my professional career to study. The system mostly works all the same.

It is with that in mind that I ask what exactly is your strategy as you approach both the problem of Trump and your overall goal of re-election. If it makes sense to you, it does not make sense to me.

You have otherwise carved a reputation as the most consistently anti-Trump Republican Senator in Washington right now. I consider this good. [You had previously bemoaned](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/10/politics/lindsey-graham-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-2016/) that a Trump nomination would lead to a landslide victory for Hillary Clinton even if the popular vote prediction you made did not square with the electoral college outcome. You were conspicuous in withholding your endorsement, which gives you more credentials to critique Trump than other colleagues like John McCain and, [your dear friend, Ted Cruz](http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/26/politics/lindsey-graham-ted-cruz-dinner/). You even you said [you voted for Evan McMullin](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/lindsey-graham-votes-for-evan-mcmullin-230954).

I approve of your criticism of President Trump, but they open you to a primary challenge in 2020. Do you remember [that brief moment in October 2013](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/lindsey-graham-approval-polls-099086) when your approval rating in South Carolina sank before your primary? I do. That happened because you had put yourself at the fore of the GOP by advocating for comprehensive immigration reform. That is good policy, but it was bad politics for dedicated partisans that vote in primaries. You survived the primary vote, but your more vocal criticism of Donald Trump---for better or worse, the face of your party---makes you even more vulnerable to a primary challenge. Jeff Flake, a colleage of yours, has already noted [he expects Donald Trump to support a primary challenger to him](http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/jeff-flake-gop-senator-vulnerable-primary). [John Kasich lost an intra-party chair nomination fight](http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2017/01/06/trump-vs-kasich-ohio-gop-chairman-vote/96125142/) in Ohio to Donald Trump as well. Your more vocal criticism of Donald Trump exposes you to the same problem, especially in a presidential election year. God knows [Lee Bright](http://www.goupstate.com/news/20170102/lee-bright-says-he-has-no-regrets-6-months-after-defeat) would love another crack at the position and he has all sorts of free time on his hands now. 

If your goal is to criticize President Trump with the idea you could (unlikely) avoid a primary challenge and cater more to centrists amid changing demographics in South Carolina, I wonder if your strategy toward that end may be suboptimal. You were the most consistent of your Republican colleagues in your criticism of Trump but you have done little to signal that to centrist voters you may want to court. You are still voting for his Cabinet nominees and glibly dismissing reservations from those of us in the center. You have pledged [your support for Rex Tillerson](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lindsey-graham-says-he-is-supporting-rex-tillerson-nomination/), which stands at direct odds with the hawkish sentiment you profess toward Russia. You have pledged various policies to check Trump's worst excesses and thus far have done nothing about them. We call this an ["audience cost"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audience_cost) in my field---i.e. the cost incurred for making a threat and failing to follow through. This audience cost means you are less likely to get votes from independents and moderate Democrats you may want. Partisanship is too strong for Democrats to break ranks. Independents will break for the opposition party the extent to which Trump is [already historically unpopular](http://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2017/01/poll-trumps-transition-is-historically-unpopular-233583) and a majority of [Americans expect he will do a bad job in office](http://time.com/4620230/donald-trump-gallup-poll-president/). Even a large share of Republicans [voted for Trump but expect him to do a bad job](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/10/gop_voters_who_don_t_like_trump_reveal_their_votes.html). Again, partisanship is that strong. You are not doing enough to signal a serious intent to rise above it for the cause of the greater common good.

I write you with that basic inquiry. What exactly is your strategy toward re-election and countering the authoritarian threat of a President Trump if you make veiled threats to check him but do not follow through? That alienates Republicans who, let us be frank, [like him more than you](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/upshot/republicans-have-one-big-incentive-to-stick-with-trump.html?smid=tw-upshotnyt&smtyp=cur&_r=0) and will break for a Trump-backed primary challenger in 2020 if Trump aggressively backs one like he is threatening to do against Jeff Flake in Arizona. Why do you make these open challenges to President Trump but fail to follow it with meaningful policy proposals that centrists and moderate Democrats may enjoy? How does that assure voters like me that your electoral interest happens to correspond with the public goods of civil liberties and civil rights on which I depend? I honestly do not understand how your strategy makes sense as you have executed it thus far. It would be putting it mildly to say you have been "uneven" and "inconsistent" in mapping your electoral interest with the national interest that citizens want.

I look forward to your response, though I suspect it will be a form letter that does not address the substance of the concerns and inquiries I raise here. You are an astute and clever politician. The good ones that last for multiple terms are. It has shown since you first arrived in Washington with the "Republican Revolution" of 1994. Right now, your behavior does not make sense to a concerned citizen like me.

Best regards,

Steven V. Miller
