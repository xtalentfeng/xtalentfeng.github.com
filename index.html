		<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="http://english.ucas.ac.cn/">University of Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> . I major in cyber security and my research brings a data-driven approach to the study of computer and network security. My work focus on defending the Internet’s physical core infrastructure, and guide the design and deployment of widely-used physical systems.

		<p>
		My comprehensive grade ranked top 5 in communication engineering of <a href="http://en.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University </a> and then I am recommend to Chinese Academy of Sciences for Ph.D. degree. To date, I have worked on device discovery and identification for embedded systems and industrial control systems for 2 years and gained a lot of project experience. In research, I’m familiar with data mining and network measurement and develop several data analysis and visualization tools. I have published five research articles and there are still five papers about discovery and analysis of Internet devices.

		<p>To date, I have worked on device discovery and identification of embedded systems and industrial control
		systems for 3 years and gained a lot of project experience. The primary objective of my work is to develop
		algorithms and systems for Industrial devices in the cyber space. To be able to identify the right problems,
		I need a deep understanding of several areas. It also requires strong capabilities to translate algorithms
		into the meaningful implementations. Both my research record and potential are on par with the best
		systems students in the Chinese academic science.<p>
